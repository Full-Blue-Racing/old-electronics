This is the code for the steering wheel,

The single_test was for the breadboarded screen and LEDs, this worked in
isolation with the code generating rpm and clt values to be displayed

The other two pieces of code went on two arduinos. One was in the dash and
had the can circuitry, it then extracted the relevant information and sent 
it over a serial link to another arduino in the steering wheel which controlled
the screen and the LEDs. 

We encountered two problems:
-Serial is annoying to get working between two arduinos (basically like
working with an incomplete library). This resulted in the serial communications
interfering with the screen (believed to be due to using the same register to
communicate with each device) so we only ran the RPM LEDs
-The CAN circuitry in the dash was never tested and it never worked, this 
could be due to a multitude of things but the learning point is to test
PCBs you have designed, even if it worked on a breadboard
