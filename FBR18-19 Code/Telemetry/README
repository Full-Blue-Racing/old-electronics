This is a tutorial on using the NRF24l01 radio modules to transmit data,

These have been tested roughly and are suitable for the distances we want to use
but they have not been tested with the engine running (emf noise might be 
significant)

Might be worth doing research on other radio modules/solutions that we can use
before you begin coding but if possible use these as they are very cheap 
(will require extensive testing first though - hint to get them to work is
to encase the electronics is a faraday shield)
